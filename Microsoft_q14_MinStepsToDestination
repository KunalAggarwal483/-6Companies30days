//ques - Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, youmust take i steps. Given a destination D , find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.



int minSteps(int D){
        // code here
         int steps = 0, sum = 0;
        while(true){
            sum = sum + steps;
            steps++;
            if(sum == D){
                return steps-1;
                break;
            }
            if(sum > D and (sum-D)%2 == 0){
                return steps-1;
                break;
            }
        }
