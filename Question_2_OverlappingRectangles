//  This is a functions written in c++ to return whether 2 rectangles given by 2 vertices each are overlapping or not

Question - Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. (L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).


 int doOverlap(int L1[], int R1[], int L2[], int R2[]) {
        // code here
        if(L2[1]<R1[1] || R2[1]>L1[1] || L2[0]>R1[0] || R2[0]<L1[0])
        return 0;
        else
        return 1;
    }
